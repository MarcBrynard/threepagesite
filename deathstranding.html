<p class="article1">Death Stranding is an upcoming open world action video game being developed by Kojima Productions and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4. It is the first game by game director Hideo Kojima and his company following the 2015 disbandment of Kojima Productions as a subsidiary of Konami and subsequent reformation as an independent studio, and was officially announced at Sony's E3 2016 conference. The game will be released sometime prior to 2019.

The game features actors Norman Reedus and Mads Mikkelsen, as well as director Guillermo del Toro, who are portrayed in-game via motion capture. The game's title is a reference to the cetacean stranding phenomenon</p>

	<p class="article2">"You're leaving the world you know, and entering somewhere completely different." Those were the words spoken to us as we entered Kojima Productions’ brand-new and incredibly-impressive studio space in the Shinagawa ward of Tokyo. Mere blocks away from Sony’s Japan Studio, Kojima Productions is one of the strangest-but-fitting studios I’ve ever visited, and taking a tour of the space and speaking with the team has me even more excited for Death Stranding.

The video at the top of this page shows a full tour of the new Kojima Productions studio, so be sure to check it out.

The office starts normal enough, with a small room that houses a spartan trophy case, including a pair of E3 2016 IGN awards. But upon tapping your employee ID badge on a futuristic-looking podium, a wall opened up, revealing a sight that I’ve never seen before in the dozens of games studios I’ve visited. As Hideo Kojima himself told us, “I want to make something no one has ever seen before, to take them to a place they have never been, to teach them something new.”</p>

<p class="article3">As for Kojima himself, he said that starting the studio a year ago was like building and launching a spaceship. He needed a crew that he knew and trusted to get them into orbit. Now that they're out in space, he wants people who can help take him to uncharted planets. They’re bringing in folks from the games industry who come from outside of Japan, as well as people who come from completely different mediums like film and sculpture. None of that comes as a surprise, considering the assortment of objects that adorned his office, and it further enforces Kojima’s commitment to continue pushing the medium that he’s helped craft over the past 30 years. As far as what happens after Death Stranding, the team doesn’t have any concrete plans, but is definitely open to the thought of branching out to new mediums.

Speaking further with Kojima, he doesn't come across as jaded. He doesn't come across as a man who holds a grudge, but rather a person who got out of a long-term relationship. The breakup might've been messy, especially given the public nature of it, but Kojima is a creator who understands that every step of his journey, no matter how perilous and wrought with obstructions, was crucial to get him to where he is today. In his own words, “Everything I experienced over 53 years; movies I’ve seen, books I’ve read, music I’ve listened to, games I’ve played, people I’ve met and the 30 years spent in this industry, have formed who I am. Not one of these things has been without purpose, including my experience creating games at Konami.”</p>
