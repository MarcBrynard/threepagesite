<p class="article1">The year is 2005, six years after the downfall of Zanzibarland.[23] A renegade genetically-enhanced special forces unit, FOXHOUND, has seized a remote island in Alaska's Fox Archipelago codenamed "Shadow Moses", the site of a nuclear weapons disposal facility.[21] FOXHOUND threatens to use the nuclear-capable mecha, Metal Gear REX, against the U.S. government if they do not receive the remains of Big Boss and the ransom of $1 billion within 24 hours.[24] Solid Snake is forced out of retirement by Colonel Roy Campbell to infiltrate the island and neutralize the threat.[25]

Snake enters the facility via an air vent and locates the first hostage, DARPA Chief Donald Anderson. Anderson reveals that Metal Gear REX can be deactivated with a secret detonation override code, but dies of a heart attack.[26] Colonel Campbell's niece Meryl Silverburgh, held hostage in an adjoining cell,[27] helps Snake escape. Snake locates another hostage, ArmsTech president Kenneth Baker,[7] but is confronted by FOXHOUND member Revolver Ocelot. Their gunfight is interrupted by a mysterious cyborg ninja who cuts off Ocelot's right hand. Baker briefs Snake on the Metal Gear project and advises him to contact Meryl, whom he gave a PAL card that might prevent the launch, but he too dies of a sudden heart attack.[28][29]

Over Codec, Meryl agrees to meet in the warhead disposal area on the condition that Snake contacts Metal Gear's designer, Dr. Hal "Otacon" Emmerich. En route, Snake receives an anonymous codec call warning him of a tank ambush.[30] Snake fends off the attack from Vulcan Raven and proceeds to the rendezvous, where he locates Otacon. The ninja reappears and Snake realizes it is his former ally Gray Fox, believed dead.[31] Otacon agrees to aid Snake remotely using special camouflage to procure information and supplies.</p>

	<p class="article2">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty[a] is an action-adventure stealth game developed and published by Konami for the PlayStation 2 in 2001. It is the fourth Metal Gear game written and directed by Hideo Kojima and serves as the direct sequel to the original Metal Gear Solid. An expanded edition, titled Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance, was released the following year for Xbox and Microsoft Windows in addition to the PlayStation 2.

The story revolves around the "Big Shell", a massive offshore clean-up facility that has been seized by a group of terrorists who call themselves the "Sons of Liberty". They demand a massive ransom in exchange for the life of the President of the United States, and threaten to destroy the facility and create a cataclysmic environmental disaster if their demands are not met. The motives and identities of many of the antagonists and allies change throughout the course of the game, as the protagonists discover a world-shaking conspiracy constructed by a powerful organization known as the Patriots.

While the game received acclaim for its gameplay, graphics, and its attention to detail, critics were divided on the protagonist and the philosophical nature and execution of the game's storyline, which explores themes such as memetics, social engineering, political conspiracies, censorship, artificial intelligence, existentialism, postmodernism and post-truth politics. The game's reputation has improved over the years and it is considered to be one of the greatest video games made. The game has shipped over 7 million copies worldwide and scored an average Metacritic aggregate score of 96%, making it one of the highest-rated games of all time.[1]</p>

<p class="article3">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater[a] is an action-adventure stealth video game produced by Konami Computer Entertainment Japan for the PlayStation 2.[11] It was released in late 2004 in North America and Japan, then in early 2005 in Europe and Australia. It was the fifth Metal Gear game written and directed by Hideo Kojima and serves as a prequel to the previous installments.[12]

Set in 1964 (three decades before the events of the original Metal Gear), the story centers on FOX operative codenamed Naked Snake as he attempts to rescue a Russian rocket scientist by the name of Nikolai Stepanovich Sokolov, sabotage an experimental superweapon, and assassinate his defected former boss.[13] While previous games were set in a primarily urban environment, Snake Eater adopts a 1960s Soviet jungle setting,[1] with the high tech, near-future trappings of previous Metal Gear Solid games being replaced with the wilderness. While the setting has changed, the game's focus remains on stealth and infiltration, while retaining the series' self-referential, fourth wall-breaking sense of humor.[13] The story of Snake Eater is told through numerous cut scenes and radio conversations.[14]

Considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater was critically acclaimed, receiving praise for its story, gameplay, graphics, setting, characters and ending, as well as departing from the series' typical conventions. Snake Eater was a commercial success, having sold 3.6 million copies worldwide by August 2005.[15]</p>
