<p class="article1">Big Boss is one of the central characters in the Metal Gear video game series. He was introduced in the original Metal Gear games for the MSX2 as the commanding officer and subsequent nemesis of Solid Snake. He is later featured as Naked Snake, the protagonist of Metal Gear Solid prequels where he is initially depicted as an American Special Forces Operator and decorated war hero until political manipulations cause him to be disillusioned, and he started his own private mercenary company. Big Boss's character has been praised by video game publications for his role as a villain as well for his relationship with Solid Snake. As the series' chronology progressed, his exact allegiance and motivations became increasingly complex; his first appearances are depicted as a traitor dreaming of a world of perpetual war, but subsequent appearances have revealed him to be a key figure in an ideological dispute that shaped the latter half of the twentieth century and a man whose conscience was disturbed by the attitude of leaders towards soldiers, prompting his decision to become a soldier of fortune and Venom Snake's mental template.</p>

	<p class="article2">In the Metal Gear series, The Boss is a legendary American female soldier, founder and leader of the Cobra unit, the biological mother of Ocelot,[3] mentor and mother figure to Naked Snake, and is known as the mother of the U.S. special forces.[4] In June 1944, during World War II, she led the Cobra unit to victory at the Battle of Normandy.

The Boss appears as the main antagonist in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. She moved to the Soviet Union with Colonel Volgin alongside the Cobra Unit.[5] Throughout the game, Naked Snake repeatedly encounters The Boss to kill her as ordered by his superiors. Following Volgin's death, The Boss reveals she is the daughter of one of the original members of the Philosophers behind the Philosophers' Legacy. After one final fight, Snake fights and kills The Boss who gives him the Philosophers' Legacy hidden by Volgin. The whole mission is later revealed to be a coverup by the United States so that The Boss would steal Volgin's treasure and give it to Snake but then die at his hands to avoid a conflict between America and the Soviet Union.[6][7]

EVA reveals in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker that The Boss infiltrated a sleeper agent into the USSR's OKB-1 from 1959 to 1961 to gather more information about the Sputnik program with a little help from the Philosophers. She was eventually commissioned into Project Mercury to test the Mercury capsule and launched into space at roughly the same time as Yuri Gagarin's flight on April 12, 1961. However, the capsule suffered heavy damage upon reentry. The Boss, dubbed within the program as the "Mercury Lady", survived the crash but was rendered comatose for six months. All evidence of her role in the program was erased, including airbrushing her out of an official picture of the Mercury astronauts, she being the eighth member.[8] The Boss's entire personality is also reconstructed in a special AI system developed by Strangelove for the Peace Walker weapon.</p>

<p class="article3">As for Kojima himself, he said that starting the studio a year ago was like building and launching a spaceship. He needed a crew that he knew and trusted to get them into orbit. Now that they're out in space, he wants people who can help take him to uncharted planets. They’re bringing in folks from the games industry who come from outside of Japan, as well as people who come from completely different mediums like film and sculpture. None of that comes as a surprise, considering the assortment of objects that adorned his office, and it further enforces Kojima’s commitment to continue pushing the medium that he’s helped craft over the past 30 years. As far as what happens after Death Stranding, the team doesn’t have any concrete plans, but is definitely open to the thought of branching out to new mediums.

Speaking further with Kojima, he doesn't come across as jaded. He doesn't come across as a man who holds a grudge, but rather a person who got out of a long-term relationship. The breakup might've been messy, especially given the public nature of it, but Kojima is a creator who understands that every step of his journey, no matter how perilous and wrought with obstructions, was crucial to get him to where he is today. In his own words, “Everything I experienced over 53 years; movies I’ve seen, books I’ve read, music I’ve listened to, games I’ve played, people I’ve met and the 30 years spent in this industry, have formed who I am. Not one of these things has been without purpose, including my experience creating games at Konami.”</p>
